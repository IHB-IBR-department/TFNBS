# Threshold-Free Network-Based Statistics in Neuroscience

TFNBS - is a python package for computation of network based statistics for Neuroscience (e.g. fMRI, EEG data etc). The library presents our implementation of Threshold Free calculation of statistics using existing frameworks in a simpleified package. The core concept of threshold free statitistics has been implemented from [REF_1] with NBS [REF_2] in contrast. This package enables users to perform threshold free statistics calculations using TFNOS framework of networks.
