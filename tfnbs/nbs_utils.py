# inputs: Group 1, Group2, threshold, permutation, paired, seed, 
# myabe tail? 


# Initial T Test for the groups and acquire T-statistics matrix 

# Get binary matrix - w.r.t threshold 

# Get adjacency matrix
# Calculate conected components using get_Components

# Randomize labels and then perform ttest - adj matrix - find connected components -> accumulate connectd components in variable 


# Calcuilate p value: 
# Pvalues - for number connected edges
